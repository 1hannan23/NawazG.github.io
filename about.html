                            <p class="text-base">My top priorities at Greenwood will remain safety in the building, student achievement, health and wellness of our students and staff, and continued improvement of instruction that supports the development of deeper learning environments and experiences. Our gators will once again be empowered to take risks, held accountable for their own learning, inspired to think critically, and serve outside of the school walls.  We will continue to support the foundation of social and emotional development of our future community leaders as they start the journey to becoming college and career ready. Students will tap into their questions, their own sense of wonder, and empathy towards an audience. Students will be given choice, student ownership, and allowed time for inquiry in order to foster creativity and navigate their own learning. .</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">For me personally, the valleys the past two years have me understand and comprehend the blessing that we have at our school. I learned much about life during the 1.5 years of loss, isolation, quarantines, and computer screens. I struggled as my students and personal children did not have a choice to attend school in person. During this time, I realized even more that people create magic. Therefore, this year more than ever, I want to do more, be more, grow more, and create more moments for others. My passion for children will flow through our school vision, mission, and community. Nothing will stop us! </p>
